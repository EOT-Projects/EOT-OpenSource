# Open Source EOT

### tl;dr

An idea for open source developers to make a real income for their work. No matter how little or much you have contributed: If your code is being used, you are getting paid. 
The only catch: this needs big support from the open source community to come to life. 

### Problem (Status Quo):
Open Source projects are indispensable, yet their developers are in most cases not compensated for their work, making it hard maintaining crucial projects. Meanwhile many companies profit enormously off of that work without paying a penny. Many companies would be willing to give back to the community, but there is no practicable or fair way of doing so. Until now.

### Solution:
Profitable companies will be prompted to pay a fair share when using open source software - voluntarily. This process will be handily implemented for them right into package managers: once a year they are asked to fill out a short survey when interacting with their package managers. If you are a profitable company you are asked to pay a fair amount (the suggested amount is being calculated for you) and in return you receive a badge that you can put on your website. A merit-based algorithm is then distributing the payments to all involved open-source developers, based on their contributions to the packages that are used by the companies project. So this new algorithm will assess all contributions made to an open-source package and in turn how important each package was for the end users project (more under "calculation" below).
This amount will be paid solely voluntary by companies. At some later point some open-source projects might decide to take this one step further by changing their license and making it obligatory for profitable companies to pay a certain amount (this will make things more complicated, you can read more and discuss in issue [#9 mandatory payments](https://github.com/EOT-Projects/EOT-OpenSource/issues/9)).
Those who are prompted to fill out the survey but not developing for a big company are simply able to skip it with just one click. 

### Example:
When FooBarSaaS company is running their package installer _yarn_ to update their SaaS-App, _yarn_ is prompting them (once a year) to fill out a short survey. As they are highly profitable and this project alone made them 3m in profits last year, they are prompted to pay $200 for that year. They decide to overspend and pay three times the amount, earning them a special "gold status open source supporter 2025" badge they can put on their website. 

### Context:
This idea is part of a larger idea: EOT. A new kind of organization that has no owners but instead distributes all profits between its contributors. No employees, everyone is an entrepreneur but at the same time part of a team. The two ideas are not dependent on each other, but they can join forces on many projects, like the contribution-calculation-algorithm.

### Calculation in short:
- the goal is to calculate how much value each contribution brought into a project. Awarded is not the amount of code but rather the improvement that was made. 
- the goal is to make the distribution as fair as possible while finding a balance between making it encouraging for new improvements and still rewarding what was already there and being built upon.
- any solution can always be replaced with a better solution. The replaced one is still being rewarded as each contribution is built on top of other things. if for example some part of a library is being replaced completely, the algorithm also takes into account how much of the new solution is new and how much it has built on the previous version

### Companies might use multiple package managers and other open source software
Thatâ€™s why the actual payments will be carried out through a website. After the package managers' survey, the company is redirected to a website where they can fill out their details, and combine the data collected by multiple package managers, allowing them to make a single payment and receive a single badge.   
Software that is distributed outside package managers, like Docker and Wordpress, can link directly to this website. After one year, companies are reminded  automatically by email.
